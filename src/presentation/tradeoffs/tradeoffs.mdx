#### Hooks Reception

**Excitement:**

- "Hook ALL THE THINGS!"
- "I write all my code with hooks now"
- "Why would anyone still use classes?"


**And real-world questions:**

- "How do I test components that depend on an outside data source like a Redux store?"
- "Doesn't use of hooks and context reduce separation of concerns?"
- "What about the 'noise' from writing a bunch of hooks and callbacks inline in the component?"


---

#### What's Actually New with Hooks?

**In some ways: NOTHING!**

- Class components already had state and side effects
- Logic _could_ be extracted into functions if you wanted to
- Function components "just" do the same things now


**In other ways: EVERYTHING!**

- Function components _can_ have state and effects
- Can write entire apps without using classes
- Logic can be co-located and trivially extracted for reuse
- No more `this`, but now have to understand closures 
- Components are larger because of need for closures


---

#### "Separation of Concerns?"

Hooks deliberately make different tradeoffs on the "separation of concerns" and "simplicity" spectrums than HOCs do:


- **HOCs:**
    - Promote writing plain components that receive all data as props, keeping them generic, decoupled, and potentially reusable
    - Potential name clashes, extra layers in the component tree and DevTools, extremely complex static typing, and edge cases like ref access
- **Hooks:**
    - Shrink the component tree, promote extracting logic as plain functions, are easier to statically type, and are more easily composable
    - Lead towards a stronger coupling with dependencies (especially for any use of context) 
    
**Hooks deliberately lead away from "separation of concerns"**. A component now explicitly expects to read its own 
data from somewhere _and_ render it. You could write separate components for fetching and rendering, but now you've 
reinvented the HOC.

#### React-Redux Usage: `connect`

- Recommendation: ["Keep components components unaware of Redux"](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/why-use-react-redux#it-encourages-good-react-architecture):

> They should simply receive data and functions as props, just like any other React component. This ultimately makes it easier to test and reuse your own components.

- Don't use `props.dispatch()` directly - [move async logic outside components to keep it reusable](https://redux.js.org/faq/actions#how-can-i-represent-side-effects-such-as-ajax-calls-why-do-we-need-things-like-action-creators-thunks-and-middleware-to-do-async-behavior)

#### React-Redux Usage: `connect`


- Use [action creators, thunks, and `mapDispatch`](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2016/10/idiomatic-redux-why-use-action-creators/) to dispatch actions without explicit mention of `dispatch` at the call site, and to enable generic "presentational" components:

> In general, Redux suggests that code with side effects should be part of the action creation process. While that logic can be performed inside of a UI component, it generally makes sense to extract that logic into a reusable function so that the same logic can be called from multiple placesâ€”in other words, an action creator function.

- Automatically optimizes re-renders based on parent props

#### React-Redux Usage: `connect`



"Container/presentational" concept over-interpreted by the community. Still useful, but being de-emphasized:

- Dan Abramov has marked his ["container/presentational" article as outdated](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
- Our [planned Redux docs revamp](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3313) will drop that phrasing from the "Usage with React" page 

---

#### React-Redux Usage: Hooks

- `useSelector` just formalizes [the "selector function" concept we've already encouraged](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/12/idiomatic-redux-using-reselect-selectors/)
    - Can potentially reuse `mapState` functions if memoized, or used with `shallowEqual` comparison
- `useDispatch` means you always have `dispatch` directly available
    - Drops the "bound action creator" abstraction
    - Can easily write async code in a `useEffect` and dispatch
    - Not as much _need_ to externalize async logic in thunks?
- Can use both of them in [custom hooks for more complex logic](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-convert-your-existing-redux-containers-to-hooks/)
- No wrapper component, so you'll need to wrap in `React.memo()` to optimize re-renders if necessary

React-Redux hooks do couple the component more tightly to Redux, because that's true for any component that is using context rather than props. 
There's an implicit dependency on that context instance and the data being provided.

#### Conclusions: It's About Tradeoffs

**Neither approach is "right" or "wrong" - it's about what tradeoffs you want to make:**

- How much do you want to "separate concerns"?
- Do you prefer "shallow" testing of components, or fully "mounting/integrating" them?
- How important are shallow component trees and static typing?

**It'll take a long time to figure out best practices:**  

- Mixins -> HOCs -> Render Props -> Hooks took years of evolution
- What will hooks usage patterns look like a few years from now?

**Is your code ["app-centric" or "component-centric"](https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1056669495354421249)?**

- Is React itself your actual "app"?
- Or is it the "view layer" on top of external state and logic?
